## About the Project

This application simulates a lightweight e-commerce and warehouse management platform, inspired by services like Allegro. It is designed for educational purposes to explore full-stack development with a focus on both frontend interactions and backend logic.

The app allows users to:
- Display and add products, orders, categories, and warehouse shelves
- View product rankings based on popularity or order frequency
- Generate basic charts and visualizations (e.g., for product sales or stock levels)
- Practice CRUD operations and database handling
- Explore concepts of structured data organization (e.g., by category or shelf)

The primary goal is to understand how modern web applications work â€” from data modeling and server-side logic to user interface creation and dynamic content rendering.
